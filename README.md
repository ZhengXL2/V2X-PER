# V2X-PER
V2X-PER: A Pose-Robust One-Stage BEV Fusion Framework for Multi-Agent Collaborative Perception

This repository provides the official implementation of our one-stage collaborative perception framework for multi-agent autonomous driving scenarios. It features end-to-end sensor fusion, robust spatial alignment, and enhanced perception under pose perturbations.

## üìå Open Source Roadmap

We plan to open-source the project in several phases to ensure code quality, documentation completeness, and reproducibility.

| Phase | Content                                                                 | Status     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£   | Release model architecture                                               | üîÑ Completed |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£   | Provide training & evaluation scripts, pretrained models                 | ‚¨ú In Progress |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£   | Release dataset preprocessing tools and visualization utilities         | ‚¨ú Pending |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£   | Publish benchmark results & detailed documentation                       | ‚¨ú Pending |

Stay tuned! We are actively maintaining and improving the codebase.
